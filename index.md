# Biography

I am currently working as a postdoc at Copenhagen Business School (CBS) on a Horizon 2020 project called ENLIGHTEN ("European Legitimacy in Governing through Hard Times: The Role of European Networks"). You can read more about that project [here](http://enlightenproject.eu/). At CBS, I am part of the [Department of Business and Politics](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-business-and-politics).

I hold a PhD in political and social science from an Erasmus Mundus dual-degree doctorate program called [GEM](http://www.erasmusmundus-gem.eu/) ("Globalization, Europe and Multilateralism"). That program has been succeeded by [GEM-STONES](https://gem-stones.eu/). During my PhD, I was affiliated to the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom and L'Université libre de Bruxelles in Belgium. I also spent time at Université Laval in Canada and CBS, Denmark. My pre-doctoral studies were completed at CBS.
