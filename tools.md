# Tools and data

My approach to social science research is eclectic, and I don't shy away from a particular set of tools or theories if they don't fit my current paradigm. I think it's more important to ask good questions and find compelling case studies.

Having said that, because of the things that interest me and the questions I've asked, I've tended to gravitate towards approaches that take discourse, ideas, and network relations seriously as organizing concepts in the study of society.
