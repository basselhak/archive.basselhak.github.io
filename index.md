# Biography

I am currently working as a postdoc at Copenhagen Business School (CBS) on a Horizon 2020 project called ENLIGHTEN ("European Legitimacy in Governing through Hard Times: The Role of European Networks"). You can read more about that project [here](http://enlightenproject.eu/). At CBS, I am part of the [Department of Business and Politics](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-business-and-politics).

I hold a PhD in political and social science from an Erasmus Mundus dual-degree doctorate program called [GEM](http://www.erasmusmundus-gem.eu/) ("Globalization, Europe and Multilateralism"). That program has been succeeded by [GEM-STONES](https://gem-stones.eu/). During my PhD, I was affiliated to the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom and L'Université libre de Bruxelles in Belgium. I also spent time at Université Laval in Canada and CBS, Denmark. My pre-doctoral studies were completed at CBS. 

# Research interests and themes

The overarching theme that runs through my research is the interaction between bureaucracy and innovation. I am particularly interested in understanding how disruptive and controversial technologies challenge policymakers by instigating contentious public debates. In these debates, policymakers, business representatives, technical/scientific experts, NGOs, and the general public collide in dizzying and shifting patterns of action and talk. My job is to find signals in this noise, and I do so with a broad array of tools, theories, and methods. 

- Innovation, technological change, disruption
- European Union, transnational regulation & governance, public policy
- Framing, lobbying, collective action
